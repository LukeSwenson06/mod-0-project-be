## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * One point that resonated with me was from the podcast where the guest was speaking about making the change in your mind to go from a more "I was born this way so I can't change" mindset to a growth mindset where we can be capable of anything
  we set our minds too.
  * Another point that resonated with me is from the article where the author talks about S.M.A.R.T Goals and how they should be utilized to breakdown larger coding projects and tackle things in a timely manner, like the MOD 0 project.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * Ways that I demonstrated a growth mindset is believing in my ability to learn and not compare myself to others. My own self belief allows to me to take in information more, ask questions, and admit that I may not be right.
  * The way I do not demonstrate a growth mindset is working through challenges as much as I should. Sometimes i'll be handling a problem for like 30 - 40 minutes and then i'll take a long break. In the long break it could seen as procrastinating or getting my mind right.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  * A conditional statement could be defined as a fork where the data you are using needs to be defined more so whatever you type, will lead to an outcome that is true.

  1. Money = 100

  if x == 100
    puts "That's a lot of money!"
  end

  2. if x = 6
   puts "x is 6"
  end

  3. miles_ran = 5  

  if x == 5
    puts "Thats a lot of miles"
  elsif x > 4
    puts "I could have ran more"
  end

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  * You want to use an if-statement when you want your outcome to be true. You will place a conditionals to meet all possible outcomes so your data will print a true statement to the user. If you don't us if-statements then your users will run into error messages or nil (False) outcomes.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  * The ruby syntax for the if-statement would be the `if`,`else`, `elsif` and `end`

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
  * To add multiple conditions to an if statement you will need to use `elsif` and `else`.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

  1. `if lemons < 1
    puts "Sorry we are out of stock"
  elseif lemons == 4
    puts "Here is a coupon for a discount"
  else
    puts "Thank you for your order"
  end`
