## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
  * My workflow felt way more efficient on getting things done. I have my pomodoro set to 25 minutes which flies by really fast.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
  * I downloaded a pomdoro app and I did find myself way more focused on my work since focusing is in short bursts rather then long 55 minute intervals which I was accustomed to when I was in the military.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
  * A hash is a collection of key-value pairs, that allows the user to pull from any of the values using the keys. They are different from arrays because arrays go in sequential order from 0..5 etc. while hashes dont have any numerical order.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
  * `pet_store = {'Dog Bones' => 130, 'Dog Food Bags' => 29, 'Cat toys' => 24 }`

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
  * I would access the value `Iowa` I would use `states["IA"]`

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
  * All keys `states.keys`
  * All values `states.values`

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
  * You might use a hash when you have a bunch of items that are in no particular order but need to be cataloged. Such as store inventory, store inventory you have an item and the value of the item either that may be monetary value or how many pieces you have of the item associated with it. You can use a hash to associated those values with the item itself. Array would not work because it will index all the items which will not be useful in this scenario.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
  * Not really a question but excited to utilize them in more exciting and complex ways and integrate them in formulas.
