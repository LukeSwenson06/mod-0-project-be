## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
  * For me, I am somewhere in between when asking questions because I usually don't ask them since I figure the answer myself most of the time.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
  * I would print the string hello world to the terminal by putting `puts "Hello World!"`. Then I would go into the terminal and type ruby file_name. That would print it.

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
  * #

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
  * Integers are whole numbers like 5 and floats have a decimal point like 5.0

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
  * `animal = "zebra"`

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
  * p animal

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
  * interpolation is sticking data or variables in the middle of a string.
  `p "the #[animal] lives in Africa"`

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
  * the octothorpe

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
  * .length tells you how many characters there are in a string
  * .sub and gsub is substituting parts of a string, sub does it for one occurrence, gsub does it on a global occurrence.
